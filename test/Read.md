YOO this is the cpp_07 we will learn about Templates, so what is A template?


instead of doing a function overloding we use template instead 
this is the syntax template <typename T>
T = type hold the type of the parameter

or called generics are implementation using templates 
but in Cpp we say templates and java ect we use Generics keyword


So for this Day We have only 3exrcices :

ex00 = Focus on Function templates (concept Generic function)
ex01 = Focus on Templates + function as argument (concept is 	Higher-order funcion)
ex02 = Focus on Class Templates (concept is generic data structures like std::vercor)

// A Funcion tamplate = decribe what a finction looks like. 
// Can be use to generate as many overloaded cuntions as needed each using a diffrent data types



  why the template are so useful:
	For avoiding the same class for int, float, char ext
